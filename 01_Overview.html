This introduction offers a tour of Lean and its features,
with a number of examples for you to play around with and explore. If
you are reading this in our online tutorial system, you can run
examples like the one below by clicking the button that says "try it
yourself."

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Lean is an implementation of a logical foundation known as <i>dependent
type theory</i>. Specifically, it implements a version of dependent type
theory known as the <i>Calculus of Inductive Constructions</i>. The <i>CIC</i>
is a formal language with a small and precise set of rules that
governs the formation of expressions. In this formal system, moreover,
every expression has a <i>type</i>. The type of expression indicates what
sort of object the expression denotes. For example, an expression may
denote a mathematical object like a natural number, a data type, an
assertion, or a proof.
</p>

<p>
Lean has a small and carefully written kernel, which serves to check
that an expression is well-formed and confirm that it has a given
type. It is this kernel that gives Lean its special character.
Dependent type theory serves as a foundational language, allowing us
to describe all sorts of objects and prove things about them. The
foundational language fixes the meaning of the objects we introduce,
and the kernel ensures that the things we prove about them are
correct.
</p>

<p>
Put simply, Lean is designed to help you construct, manipulate, and
check expressions in this foundational language. This may not sound
like much, but what makes the system powerful is the fact that
dependent type theory is expressive enough to allow us to define and
reason about all sorts of objects. For example, Lean's standard
library defines the natural numbers to be the structure generated
freely and inductively by a constant, <i>zero</i>, and a unary function
<i>succ</i>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-2' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">inductive nat : Type
| zero : nat
| succ : nat → nat</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-2' style='display:none'>namespace hide

inductive nat : Type
| zero : nat
| succ : nat → nat

end hide
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-2').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
If you copy this definition into the editor window at right you will
see that we have wrapped it in a <i>namespace</i> to avoid conflicting with
the standard definition, which is loaded by default. Even so, choosing
the name <code>nat</code> means that within the namespace this identifier is
overloaded, which can cause confusion. Thus we will do this only
sparingly, for purposes of illustration.
</p>

<p>
Having specified this data type, we can go on to define addition by
recursion on the second argument:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-3' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">def add : nat → nat → nat
| m nat.zero     := m
| m (nat.succ n) := nat.succ (add m n)</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-3' style='display:none'>namespace hide

inductive nat : Type
| zero : nat
| succ : nat → nat

def add : nat → nat → nat
| m nat.zero     := m
| m (nat.succ n) := nat.succ (add m n)

end hide
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-3').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
Lean compiles definitions like these down to a single axiomatic
primitive that governs use of both induction and recursion on
inductively defined structures. The library defines notation for the
data type, as well as for <code>zero</code> and <code>add</code>. (In fact, Lean uses <i>type
classes</i>, a very handy mechanism used by functional programming
languages like Haskell, to share notation and properties across
algebraic structures.) Lean uses the Unicode character <code>ℕ</code> as alternative
notation for the type <code>nat</code>. You can enter this in an editor by
writing <code>\nat</code>.
</p>

<p>
Of course, we can also define non-recursive functions by giving an
explicit definition:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-4' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">def double (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n + n
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-4' style='display:none'>def double (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n + n
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-4').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
We can then go on to define other data types like the integers, the
rationals, and the real numbers, the booleans, characters and strings,
lists, products, disjoint sums, and so on. We can also define
algebraic structures like groups, rings, fields, vector spaces, and
categories. In fact, dependent type theory was designed to serve as a
foundation for all conventional mathematics.
</p>

<p>
This points to a first intended use of Lean: it serves as a
<i>specification language</i>, that is, a means to specify and define
mathematical objects in precise terms. With these specifications, Lean
can interpret basic objects and infer their types:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-5' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">#check (27 + 9) * 33
#check [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)] ++ [(7, 8), (9, 10)]
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-5' style='display:none'>#check (27 + 9) * 33
#check [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)] ++ [(7, 8), (9, 10)]
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-5').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
When there is no other information present to constrain the type of a
numeral, Lean assumes it denotes a natural, by default. Thus Lean can
recognize that the first expression denotes a natural number, and that
the second, a concatenation of two lists of pairs of natural numbers,
is again a list of pairs. It also remembers that <code>double</code> is a
function from the natural numbers to the natural numbers, and can
print out the definition when requested to do so:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-6' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">#check double
#print double</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-6' style='display:none'>def double (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n + n

#check double
#print double
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-6').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
Lean can reason about abstract objects as well as it can reason about
concrete ones. In the following example, we declare a type <code>G</code> with a
group structure, and variables <code>g₁</code> and <code>g₂</code> that range over <code>G</code>. With
those declarations, Lean knows that the expression <code>g₂⁻¹ * g₁ * g₂</code>
denotes an element of <code>G</code>.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-7' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">section
  variables (G : Type) [group G]
  variables g₁ g₂ : G

  #check g₂⁻¹ * g₁ * g₂
end
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-7' style='display:none'>section
  variables (G : Type) [group G]
  variables g₁ g₂ : G

  #check g₂⁻¹ * g₁ * g₂
end
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-7').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
Putting the declarations in a <code>section</code>, as we do here, delimits their
scope. In this case, the section declaration is not needed, and no
harm would be done if we had declared these variables at the top
level.
</p>

<p>
An important feature of dependent type theory is that every expression
has a computational interpretation, which is to say, there are rules
that specify how they can be <i>reduced</i> to a normal form. Moreover,
expressions in a computationally pure fragment of the language
evaluate to <i>values</i> in the way you would expect. For example,
assuming the definition does not depend on nonconstructive components
in an essential way, every closed term of type <code>ℕ</code> evaluates to a
numeral. Lean's kernel can carry out this evaluation:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-8' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">#eval (27 + 9) * 33
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-8' style='display:none'>#eval (27 + 9) * 33
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-8').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
As part of the kernel, the results of this evaluation can be highly
trusted. The evaluator is not very efficient, however, and is not
intended to be used for substantial computational tasks. For that
purpose, Lean also generates bytecode for every definition of a
computable object, and can evaluate it on demand. To process the
bytecode quickly, it uses an efficient <i>virtual machine</i>, similar to
the ones used to interpret OCaml and Python.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-9' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">#eval (27 + 9) * 33
#eval (2227 + 9999) * 33
#eval double 9999
#eval [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)] ++ [(7, 8), (9, 10)]</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-9' style='display:none'>def double (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n + n

#eval (27 + 9) * 33
#eval (2227 + 9999) * 33
#eval double 9999
#eval [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)] ++ [(7, 8), (9, 10)]
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-9').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
Relying on results from the bytecode evaluator requires a higher level
of trust than relying on the kernel. For example, for efficiency, the
bytecode evaluator uses the GNU multiple precision library to carry out
numerical computations involving the natural numbers and integers, so
the correctness of those computations are no longer underwritten by
the axiomatic foundation.
</p>

<p>
This points to a second intended use of Lean, namely, as a
<i>programming language</i>. Because dependent type theory is so
expressive, we can make use of all the usual methods and techniques of
functional programming, including higher types, type classes, records,
monads, and other abstractions. In fact, we have the entire Lean
library at our disposal. With just a few lines of code, we can write a
generic sort procedure that sorts elements of a list according to a
specified binary relation <code>r</code> on an arbitrary type <code>α</code>, assuming only
that we can determine computationally when <code>r</code> holds.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-10' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">section sort

</div>
<p>
For foundational reasons, types in Lean have to be stratified into a
hierarchy of <i>type universes</i>, and the definitions above work for any
type <code>α</code> in any such universe. We can run the procedure above on a
list of natural numbers, using the usual ordering:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-11' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">#eval insertion_sort (λ m n : ℕ, m ≤ n) [5, 27, 221, 95, 17, 43, 7, 2, 98, 567, 23, 12]</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-11' style='display:none'>section sort
universe u

local infix `≼` : 50 := r

def ordered_insert (a : α) : list α → list α
| []       := [a]
| (b :: l) := if a ≼ b then a :: (b :: l) else b :: ordered_insert l

def insertion_sort : list α → list α
| []       := []
| (b :: l) := ordered_insert b (insertion_sort l)

end sort

#eval insertion_sort (λ m n : ℕ, m ≤ n) [5, 27, 221, 95, 17, 43, 7, 2, 98, 567, 23, 12]
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-11').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
Substantial programs can be written in Lean and run by the bytecode
interpreter. In fact, a full-blown <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/leanprover/super">resolution theorem prover</a> for Lean
has been written in Lean itself.
</p>

<p>
You can profile your code by setting the relevant options:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-12' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">set_option profiler true
set_option profiler.freq 10
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-12' style='display:none'>set_option profiler true
set_option profiler.freq 10
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-12').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
The second option determines the frequency that the virtual machine is
polled with. Be careful: if the task you profile is too short, there won't
be any output! You can even implement your own <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/tree/master/library/tools/debugger">debugger</a> in Lean
itself.
</p>

<p>
What makes Lean special as a programming language is that the programs
we write define functions in a precise axiomatic framework. Which
brings us to third, and central, intended use of Lean: namely we can
make assertions about the objects we define and then go on to prove
those assertions. We can do this because the language of dependent
type theory is rich enough to encode such assertions and proofs. For
example, we can express the property that a natural number is even:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-13' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">def even (n : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ m, n = 2 * m
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-13' style='display:none'>def even (n : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ m, n = 2 * m
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-13').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
As presented, it is not clear that the property of being even is
decidable, since we cannot in general test every natural number to
determine whether any of them serves as a witness to the given
existential statement. But we can nonetheless use this definition to
form compound statements:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-14' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">#check even 10
#check even 11
#check ∀ n, even n ∨ even (n + 1)
#check ∀ n m, even n → even m → even (n + m)</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-14' style='display:none'>def even (n : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ m, n = 2 * m

#check even 10
#check even 11
#check ∀ n, even n ∨ even (n + 1)
#check ∀ n m, even n → even m → even (n + m)
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-14').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
In each case, the expression has type <code>Prop</code>, indicating that Lean
recognizes it as an assertion.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, of course, we do know that the property of being <code>even
n</code> is algorithmically decidable. We can develop any algorithm we want
for that purpose. Provided we can prove that it behaves as advertised,
we can then use Lean's type class mechanism to associate this decision
procedure to the predicate. Once we do so, we can use the predicate
<code>even</code> in conditional statements in any program.
</p>

<p>
In any case, in order to <i>prove</i> assertions like the ones above (at
least, the ones that are true), we need a proof language. Fortunately,
dependent type theory can play that role: proofs are nothing more than
certain kinds of expressions in the formal language. In the encoding
used, if <code>p</code> is any proposition, a proof of <code>p</code> is just an expression
<code>e</code> of type <code>p</code>. Thus, in Lean, checking a proof is just a special
case of checking that an expression is well-formed and has a given
type. We can prove that 10 is even as follows:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-15' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">example : even 10 := ⟨5, rfl⟩</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-15' style='display:none'>def even (n : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ m, n = 2 * m

example : even 10 := ⟨5, rfl⟩
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-15').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
In general, to prove an existential statement, it is enough to present
a witness to the existential quantifier and then show that the
subsequent claim is true of that witness. The Unicode angle brackets
just package this data together; you can enter them in an editor with
<code>\&lt;</code> and <code>\&gt;</code>, or use the ASCII equivalents <code>(|</code> and <code>|)</code>. The second
component, <code>rfl</code>, is short for reflexivity. Lean's kernel can verify
that <code>10 = 2 * 5</code> by reducing both sides and confirming that they are,
in fact, identical. (For longer expressions, Lean's simplifier, which
will be discussed below, can do this more efficiently, producing a
proof instead that carries out the calculation using binary
representations.)
</p>

<p>
As noted above, dependent type theory is designed to serve as a
mathematical foundation, so that any conventional mathematical
assertion can be reasonably expressed, and any theorem that can be
proved using conventional mathematical means can be carried out
formally, with enough effort. Here is a proof that the sum of two even
numbers is even:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-16' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">theorem even_add : ∀ m n, even m → even n → even (n + m) :=
take m n,
assume ⟨k, (hk : m = 2 * k)⟩,
assume ⟨l, (hl : n = 2 * l)⟩,
have n + m = 2 * (k + l),
  by simp [hk, hl, mul_add],
show even (n + m),
  from ⟨_, this⟩</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-16' style='display:none'>def even (n : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ m, n = 2 * m

theorem even_add : ∀ m n, even m → even n → even (n + m) :=
take m n,
assume ⟨k, (hk : m = 2 * k)⟩,
assume ⟨l, (hl : n = 2 * l)⟩,
have n + m = 2 * (k + l),
  by simp [hk, hl, mul_add],
show even (n + m),
  from ⟨_, this⟩
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-16').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
Again, we emphasize that the proof is really just an expression in
dependent type theory, presented with syntactic sugar that makes it
look somewhat like any informal mathematical proof. There is also a
tiny bit of automated reasoning thrown in: the command <code>by simp</code> calls
on Lean's built-in simplifier to prove the assertion after the <code>have</code>,
using the two facts labelled <code>hk</code> and <code>hl</code>, and the distributivity of
multiplication over addition.
</p>

<p>
Lean supports another style of writing proofs, namely, using
<i>tactics</i>. These are instructions, or procedures, that tell Lean how
to construct the requisite expression. Here is a tactic-style proof of
the theorem above:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-17' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">theorem even_add : ∀ m n, even m → even n → even (n + m) :=
begin
  intros m n hm hn,
  cases hm with k hk,
  cases hn with l hl,
  unfold even,
  existsi (k + l),
  simp [hk, hl, mul_add]
end</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-17' style='display:none'>def even (n : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ m, n = 2 * m

theorem even_add : ∀ m n, even m → even n → even (n + m) :=
begin
  intros m n hm hn,
  cases hm with k hk,
  cases hn with l hl,
  unfold even,
  existsi (k + l),
  simp [hk, hl, mul_add]
end
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-17').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>

<p>
Just as we can prove statements about the natural numbers, we can also
reason about computer programs written in Lean, because these, too,
are no different from any other definitions. This enables us to specify
properties of computer programs, prove that the programs meet their
specifications, and run the code with confidence that the results mean
what we think they mean.
</p>

<p>
The use of <code>simp</code> in the proof above points to another aspect of Lean,
namely, that it can serve as a gateway to the use of automated
reasoning. Terms in dependent type theory can be very verbose, and
formal proofs can be especially long. One of Lean's strengths is that
it can help you construct these terms, and hide the details from
you. We have already seen hints of this: in the examples above, Lean
inferred the fact that the natural numbers form an instance of
a semiring in order to make use of the theorem <code>mul_add</code>, it found a
procedure for comparing two natural numbers when we applied
<code>insertion_sort</code> with the less-than ordering, and it did some work
behind the scenes (though in this case, not much) when transforming
the recursive specification of addition on the natural numbers to a
formal definition. But a central goal of the Lean project is to
develop powerful automation that will assist in the verification of
programs and the construction of proofs as well.
</p>

<p>
It is the tactic framework that serves as a gateway to the use of
automation. Lean provides means of implementing automated reasoning
procedures in such a way that they produce formal proofs that their
results are correct. This imposes an extra burden on the
implementation, but it comes with benefits as well: automated
procedures can make full use of the Lean library and API, and the
formal justifications they produce provide a strong guarantee that the
results are indeed correct.
</p>

<p>
Which brings us to yet another aspect of Lean, namely, its role as a
<i>metaprogramming language</i>. Many of Lean's internal data structures
and procedures are exposed and available within the language of Lean
itself, via a monadic interface. We refer to the use of these
procedures as "metaprogramming" because they take us outside the formal
framework: the access points to the API are declared as constants, and
the formal framework knows nothing about them, other than their
type. Lean keeps track of which objects in the environment are part of
the trusted kernel and which make use of this special API, and
requires us to annotate the latter definitions with the special
keyword <code>meta</code>. The virtual machine, however, handles calls to the API
appropriately. This makes it possible to write Lean tactics in Lean
itself.

<p>
For example, the procedure <code>contra_aux</code> searches through two lists of
expressions, assumed to be hypotheses available in the context of a
tactic proof, in search of a pair of the form <code>h₁ : p</code> and <code>h₂ : ¬
p</code>. When it finds such a pair, it uses it to produce a proof of the
resulting theorem. The procedure <code>contra</code> then applies <code>contra_aux</code> to
the hypotheses in the local context.

<p>
The results of such a tactic are always checked by the Lean kernel, so
they can be trusted, even if the code itself is buggy. If the kernel
fails to type check the resulting term, it raises an error, and the
resulting theorem is not added to the environment.
</p>

<p>
Substantial tactics can be written in such a way, even, as noted
above, a full-blown resolution theorem prover. Indeed, many of Lean's
core tactics <i>are</i> implemented in Lean itself. The code from <code>contra</code>
above is, in fact, part of the <code>contradiction</code> tactic that is part of
Lean's standard library. Thus Lean offers a language for
expressing not just mathematical knowledge, construed as a body of
definitions and theorems, but also other kinds of mathematical
expertise, namely the algorithms, procedures, and heuristics that are
part and parcel of mathematical understanding.

We have surveyed a number of ways that Lean can be used, namely, as
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a specification language</li>
<li>a programming language</li>
<li>an assertion language</li>
<li>a proof language</li>
<li>a gateway to using automation with fully verified results, and</li>
<li>a metaprogramming language.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Subsequent chapters provide a compendium of examples for you to play
with and enjoy. These chapters are fairly short on explanation,
however, and are not meant to serve as definitive references. If you
are motivated to continue using Lean in earnest, we recommend
continuing, from here, to either of the following more expansive
introductions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a target='_blank' href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean">Theorem Proving in Lean</a></li>
<li><a target='_blank' href="https://leanprover.github.io/programming_in_lean/">Programming in Lean</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The first focuses on the use of Lean as a theorem prover, whereas
the second focuses on aspects of Lean related to programming and
metaprogramming.
